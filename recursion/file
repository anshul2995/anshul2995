faith hamesha choti problem k lie banta h.


levels and options means???
we are at a particular level and at that particular level, we will explore all the options that we have.
bottom up approach

explore all the options -->> yahi basically saari recursive calls hoti h.

F & E
tm jawab do, hum apne jawab banayenge.
n-1 tak jawab aa gya
n pe humm apna jawab banayenge.
topdown approach



 Why didn't you use the frame work for recursion that you were using in the beginning ? (Diff b/w Faith and Expectations and level and options)
  -->> Because these problems are about making choices and these type of questions are void recursion based questions where we explore multiple choices .
  In the beginning we solved questions which were not void recursion and they were questions which relied on the recursive solution for a smaller input for building
  an output for a bigger input, those were faith-expectation problems and these are  exhaustive choice exploration problems (backtracking) hence the same
  framework used in the earlier problems isn't used in these types of problems as these are predominantly two different types of recursive problems !!!!!!!
